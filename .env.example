# NOTE: This is a demo toy SaaS
# To make this work:
# 1. Configure your own authentication provider
# 2. Set up your own backend infrastructure  
# 3. Update the patched API routes in /app/api/quantum/*
# 4. Implement your own database schema
# 5. Configure your own environment variables

# The quantum algorithm libraries in /scripts/* are preserved
# But backend connectivity has been intentionally removed for security
