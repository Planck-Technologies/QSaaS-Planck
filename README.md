# Planck-QSaaS

Effortless Quantum Computing

Planck-QSaaS is Planck’s hybrid orchestration platform to run and integrate quantum workflows into data pipelines at maximum performance withou technical difficulties. It prioritizes **local-first** execution with safe **server fallback** to managed backends. The platform provides reproducible pipelines, queueing and quota controls, privacy-minded logging with user-deletions (GDPR-ready), observable metrics and alerting, and simple APIs for pilots and production rollout.

Use Planck-QSaaS to accelerate simulations, optimizations and Machine Learning workloads without rearchitecting your stack — validate with a pilot (upload a sample dataset) and get a short report with time, cost and integration recommendations.
